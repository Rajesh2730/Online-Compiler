 This project is a web-based code editor for writing and testing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time. It features live preview mode, manual code execution, and a theme toggle for light/dark modes. Users can save their code as separate files directly from the browser using FileSaver.js, making it ideal for learning, prototyping.
